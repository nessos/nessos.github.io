The MBrace programming model uses a distributed continuation-based approach elegantly manifested through computation expressions in F#.\r\n\r\n* [FsPickler](http://nessos.github.io/FsPickler) FsPickler is a serialization library that facilitates the distribution of .NET objects. The implementation focuses on performance and completeness in supported types, including F# types. It supports multiple, pluggable serialization formats including Binary, Xml, JSON and BSON. \r\n\r\n* [LinqOptimizer](http://nessos.github.io/LinqOptimizer) An automatic query optimizer for LINQ to Objects and PLINQ. LinqOptimizer compiles declarative LINQ queries into fast loop-based imperative code. The compiled code has fewer virtual calls and heap allocations, better data locality and speedups of up to 15x.\r\n\r\n* [UnionArgParser](http://nessos.github.io/UnionArgParser) A declarative CLI argument/XML configuration parser for F#.\r\n\r\n* [Vagrant](http://nessos.github.io/Vagrant) A library for distributing dynamic assemblies.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
